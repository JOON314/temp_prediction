This project implements a model for **temperature prediction**. It attempts to forecast the weather based on data provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA).

`temp1.csv` contains weather data for Seoul provided by KMA, and it can be modified to attempt weather predictions for other regions.

`data.py` and `data1.py` were used to develop the model using a package, and based on this, the functions are directly implemented as classes in `temp.py` to better understand how the data is processed and utilized.
